    "# Tuturial 1: Creating and Solving Factor Graphs\n",
    "In this tutorial you will lear the basics of factor graphs and consepts such as variables, factors, priors and how create solve and explore them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Factor Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia tels us a factor graph is a bipartite graph representing the factorization of a function.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you haven't taken some advanced statistics classes you are probably wondering, bipartite graph?, factorization?, I just want to navigate my robot.\n",
    "For robotics, factor graphs are the common language used to describe your robot's estimation problem (the function) in a way both humans and computers can understand. \n",
    "The estimation problem can be anything from robot localization, structure from motion, calibration to full PoseSLAM with parametric or non-parametric measurements and beliefs.\n",
    "A factor graph is a graphical model with two types of nodes, variables and factors, connected by edges between the variables and factors (bipartite graph). \n",
    "Variables represent the unknown random variables in the estimation problem, such as vehicle or landmark positions, sensor calibration parameters, and more.\n",
    "Factors represent the algebraic interaction between particular variables, such as wheel odometry, which is captured through edges. \n",
    "Breaking down the complex system describing your robot to a graph of variables and factors is the factorization of the function decribing your system, such as the position and orientation (pose) of your robot at any given time. \n",
    "This factorisation allows us to solve the optimization problem for every variable given every measurement described by the factors.\n",
    "See Caesar.jl docs [Graph Concepts](https://juliarobotics.org/Caesar.jl/latest/concepts/concepts/#Graph-Concepts) for more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lets build a factor graph\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will need some packages: \n",
    "- `GraphPlot` - for visualizing graphs.\n",
    "- `DistributedFactorGraphs` - standardized API for interacting with factor graphs.\n",
    "- `IncrementalInference` - Optimization routines for incremental non-parametric and parametric solutions based on factor graphs.\n",
    "- `RoME` - Robot Motion Estimate: Tools, Variables, and Factors for SLAM in robotics."
