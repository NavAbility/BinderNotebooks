    "# Tutorial 5: Less Time Wrangling Data, More Time Understanding/Actioning it\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Version: JuliaLang NavAbilitySDK.jl**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Marine operations in harbor and populated river environments will see increased autonomy with major benefits for safety and efficacy, but the navigational environment poses a number of vital challenges.  In developing and testing proof-of-concept systems, four very specific challenges arose:\n",
    "- GPS data can occasionaly drop out, specifically when maneuvering under bridges or between tall structures;\n",
    "- Various perception sensors each perform really well with reasonable availability for seeing obstacles or aiding navigation, but no one sensor alone provides a home run solution;\n",
    "- Practical development testing an operations produces large amounts of recorded robot data, but the data quickly becomes overwhelming and difficult to action;\n",
    "- How to share / integrate measurement data and navigation between agents (human or autonomous), as well as with shore side operations;\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the NavAbility Platform, we developed a case study for marine vehicle navigation which direclty addresses these problems.  The underlying SLAM solver is supported by NavAbility as open core software.  Links to the open source code and deeper discussions are available by following links from [the relevant Blog post](https://www.navability.io/2022/02/04/application-example-marine-vehicle-mapping-systems-for-collision-avoidance-and-planning/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial below shows how to interact with similar data quickly, efficiently, and with maximum ease.  This tutorial builds on previous tutorials that show how and why factor graphs are so important, as well other tutorials showing some of the robust (non-Gaussian) solver features that are available when building multi-sensor navigation and mapping systems that must combine challenging, ambiguous, and contradictory measurements and data cues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Value (Broader Application)\n",
    "\n",
    "- By being able to rapidly develop advanced multisensor perception, localization, and mapping ideas drastically reduces the cost and risk of introducing highly focussed autonomy/safety features into existing operations.\n",
    "- Access to both raw data and actionable SLAM results provides a major platform for machine learning tasks, such as training predictors that have either geometric of semantic relevance -- e.g. learning vehicle behaviors or better classifiers.\n",
    "- Access to a temporal/spatial database allows various sessions to be brought together with NavAbility's map merging technology -- this will be the discussed more in a future tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing these features through platform and open community, NavAbility is working to give you access to the similar capabilities that marjor brands like Tesla or Amazon are developing privately."
