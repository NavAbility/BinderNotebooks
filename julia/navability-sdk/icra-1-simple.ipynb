    "# Tutorial 1: Creating and Solving Factor Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Version: NavAbilitySDK.jl\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to create, solve, and explore factor graphs, as well as what variables, factors, and priors are.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Factor Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia tells us a factor graph is a bipartite graph representing the factorization of a function.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you haven't taken some advanced statistics classes you are probably wondering: Bipartite graph? Factorization? I just want to navigate my robot.\n",
    "For robotics, factor graphs are the common language used to describe your robot's estimation problem (the function) in a way both humans and computers can understand. \n",
    "The estimation problem can be anything from robot localization, structure from motion, calibration to full SLAM with parametric or non-parametric measurements and beliefs.\n",
    "A factor graph is a graphical model with two types of nodes, variables and factors, connected by edges between the variables and factors (bipartite graph). \n",
    "Variables represent the unknown random variables in the estimation problem, such as vehicle or landmark positions, sensor calibration parameters, and more.\n",
    "Factors represent the algebraic interaction between particular variables using stochastic models, for example wheel odometry between poses, which is depicted with edges. \n",
    "A graph of variables and factors is the factorization of the function describing your system, and effectively represents a breakdown of the complex problem describing your robot navigation; \n",
    "for example, the graph models the position and orientation (pose) of your robot at any given time relative to landmarks. \n",
    "This factorization allows us to solve the optimization (a.k.a. inference) problem for all variables given every measurement described by the factors.\n",
    "See Caesar.jl docs [Graph Concepts](https://juliarobotics.org/Caesar.jl/latest/concepts/concepts/#Graph-Concepts) for more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's build a factor graph\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will need some packages: \n",
    "- `NavAbilitySDK` - Access NavAbility Cloud factor graph features from Julia.\n",
    "- `LinearAlgebra` and `UUIDs` - Standard Julia libraries that will be useful."
