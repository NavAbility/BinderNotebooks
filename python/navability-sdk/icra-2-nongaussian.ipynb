    "# Non-Gaussian Measurements Tutorial 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many ways in which non-Gaussian / ambiguous measurements occur, this tutorial will simply pick one common example to illustrate the basic concepts.  We ground the tutorial in an example: imagine a wheeled robot travelling along in a straight line, using wheel encoders to estimate the distance travelled.  There is, however, a quirk, from time to time the robot gets stuck on something and the wheel's spin for a few rotations before progress continues.  We assume that our software is able to detect when the wheels are slipping, but the process is only 40% accurate.  In this tutorial we will build a basic robot localization process that can handle \\\"bad\\\" measurement data.  We restrict this to a one dimensional example with only a few variables and factors, to help familiarize yourself with multi-modal beliefs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows [one of four](https://juliarobotics.org/Caesar.jl/latest/concepts/why_nongaussian/) mechanisms by which non-Gaussian behavior can get introduced into a factor graph solution, see other tutorials for other mechanisms.  We will build a factor graph that contains multi-modal belief as well as `Uniform` and `Rayleigh` distributions, to help familiarize non-Gaussian measurements.   The ambiguous measurement example shown in this tutorial can readily be incorporated in other use cases, and also illustrates how consensus can occur when more information is included -- i.e. reducing uncertainties to unimodal marginal beliefs on each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces non-Gaussian behavior through non-Gaussian measurements in the factor graph.  This tutorial shows how measurements do not have to follow a unimodal bell curve (i.e. normal/Gaussian), but can instead introduce non-Gaussian beliefs and let the joint inference find the best marginal posterior estimates on each of the desired variables in the factor graph.  The tutorial shows a multi-modal uncertainty can be introduced from non-Gaussian measurements, and then transmitted through the system.  \n",
